    "In this exercise, you'll use Python to read, process, visualize, and draw conclusions from real data taken at a high-energy physics experiment! We'll be emphasizing real-world research skills rather than fundamental computer science, but absolutely don't hesitate to ask for more resources if you'd like to learn more. \n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this you'll know how to: \n",
    "* read formatted data files, \n",
    "* use the \"Numerical Python\" (i.e. numpy) library to work with arrays efficiently, and\n",
    "* do basic analysis/exploration of experimental data to come up with conclusions.\n",

    "* If you're just getting into physics and/or research, this is a great chance to learn some fundamental skills that will almost definitely come up in computational research. \n",

    "The πM1 beam line at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) has an electromagnetic calorimeter (pictured above) which measures the energy and timing of pions, muons, and electrons moving along the beam line. When high-energy particles enter the calorimeter, they initiate a “particle shower”, or a cascade of lower-energy secondary particles which deposit their (mostly kinetic) energy into the calorimeter. Note that all particles in the beam line have roughly the same initial speed. \n",
